			Click and drag the header of the table to move it.<br>
			Drag over the body of the table to select one or more cells.<br>
			Tap the selected cells to create a new matrix of those cells.<br>
			Hold control and click a selection to split it off into a different matrix. This will only work if the selection
			is the full width or height of the table, and is on an edge.<br>
			If a table gets stuck on the cursor, just click again.<br>
			Dont select an entire table because then there will be no way to deselect the cells in it.<br>
